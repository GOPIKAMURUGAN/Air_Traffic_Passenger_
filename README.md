# Air_Traffic_Passenger_Prediction
In order to predict future passenger numbers with accuracy, the machine learning air traffic passenger prediction project makes use of sophisticated algorithms and historical data. First, pertinent information is gathered and preprocessed, including historical passenger counts, aircraft schedules, economic indicators, and seasonal fluctuations. This process involves data cleaning, addressing missing numbers, and engineering features (holidays, economic situations, etc.) that could affect passenger traffic patterns. Then, based on the features of the data, machine learning models such as ARIMA, LSTM, or ensemble techniques are chosen and trained on the historical dataset. To verify accuracy and dependability, measures such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are used in the evaluation of the models.The models are used to forecast future passenger volumes after they have been validated, which helps airports and airlines allocate resources, improve service delivery, and optimise operations. Improved forecasting accuracy, cost savings through more efficient resource use, increased customer satisfaction through fewer interruptions, and well-informed strategic decision-making grounded in predictive insights are typical project benefits. In summary, the utilisation of machine learning for air traffic passenger prediction not only enhances present operations but also provides stakeholders with anticipatory skills to successfully handle forthcoming issues in the aviation sector.


The aviation industry may experience revolutionary changes as a result of using machine learning to air traffic passenger prediction. Airlines and airports may greatly improve operational efficiency and resource management by precisely projecting passenger volumes. By optimising aircraft schedules, workforce levels, and terminal capacity in accordance with anticipated demand, operational costs can be decreased and overall service reliability can be enhanced. Accurate forecasts can help airlines better deploy resources, modify pricing tactics, and improve customer happiness by reducing delays and improving the traveler experience.The predictive models have the potential to yield long-term sustainability and competitiveness in the market by enabling stakeholders to make educated decisions on fleet management, route planning, and infrastructure expenditures, in addition to the immediate operational benefits. This strategy, which makes use of modern analytics and machine learning techniques, not only makes daily operations better but also puts businesses in a better position to respond proactively to shifting market conditions and new trends in the airline sector.
